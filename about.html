        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Hi there - I am Grant Sadowski and this is my website that I created from the ground up using HTML, CSS and JavsScript. I got interested in coding in 2016 while living in Germany. I was looking for a creative outlet and I was curious about how websites were built and styled. But more specifically, I wanted to learn the design practices and trends around websites and how information can be the most effectively conveyed. </p>
        <p>I learned about coding from a variety of sources online. I started with Treehouse tutorials and YouTube videos to learn the basics. Once I had a foundation, I started working on this site and adding to it as I learned new concepts and tools.</p>
        <p>My goal is to combine my coding knowledge with my skills in Project Management and work for a software company.</p>
        <p>Beyond coding, I have a few other interests that I like sharing and enjoying with others.</p>
        
        <h3>Running</h3>
        <p>I have been a consistent runner since college and I don't see myself stopping anytime soon. I ran my first marathon in 2016 in Muenster, Germany while I was living overseas. The challenge of training and completing such a race was such an incredible feeling that I hope to achieve again.</p>
        <p>Since returning to Atlanta, Georgia I have been using my running time to explore the city around me and find interesting and unique things around me. I track my runs using Strava but I challenge myself to take a picture each run and post it on Twitter.</p>
        <P>Check out where I've been and what I've seen!</P>

        <h3>Traveling</h3>
        <p>I was very lucky to have the opportunity to live overseas from 2015-2017 in Germany as part of a work exchange program. I chose to live in the small, German college town called Muenster. My favorite part of living overseas was how easy it was to travel and see the rest of Europe. I explored more than 10 countries and countless cities during my time abroad.</p>
        <p>I took up photography as a way to chronicle my trips and share the sights with friends and family back home. I posted my favorite pictures to Instagram, which I invite you to view. Below are a few of my favorites</p>

        <h3>Music</h3>
        <p>This one honestly goes without saying. Music is an expression of who you are generally and how you are feeling specifically. I enjoy and am open to all types of music, which my Spotify playlists can attest to.</p>
        <p>But I also enjoy playing music - I'm learning to play the guitar with the help of a teacher and, of course, YouTube. Right now I'm focused on acoustic guitar but I'd like to progress onto learning blues progressions on electric guitar.</p>
