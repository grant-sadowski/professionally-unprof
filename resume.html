        <p>Hi there. Thanks for stopping by.</p>
        <p>I am an aspiring Web Designer and an experienced Project Manager from Atlanta, GA. I'm also an occasional photographer, traveler, and an obsessive runner, which pairs well with my foodie nature.</p>
        <p>After graduating with a Bachelor's of Science degree in Mechanical Engineering from Georgia Tech, I took a R&amp;D job designing wire feeders for welding machines. I realized that I wanted to work more on the business side of a company and transitioned to my current role as Project Manager. I was fortunate enough to spend 2 years living overseas in Germany, where I learned German and experienced an international working atmosphere.</p>
        <p>I really enjoy project management because I get to interact with interesting people inside and outside of the company. I'd really like to work for a software company and learning to code is one way that I'm learning about the process of developing software.</p>
        <p>Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>
